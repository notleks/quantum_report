[DOI](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2303.16392) | Published: 2023-03-28 | Citations: 0 

This work proposes a new framework called the "Dual Space Approach" for efficiently subtracting renormalons from perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics ([QCD](#key-definitions)). The framework enables the simultaneous subtraction of multiple renormalons and provides a one-parameter integral representation of a general observable. The study investigates the emergence and cancellation of renormalons in the operator product expansion (OPE) of an observable, using the 2-dimensional O(N) nonlinear sigma model as a solvable model. The dual space approach is shown to be useful through a simulation study.

This work explores the restoration of chiral symmetry at high matter density using pionic atoms. It measures the spectrum of pionic 121Sn atoms and studies the interaction between the pion and the nucleus. The reduction of the expectation value of the chiral condensate at finite density indicates the partial restoration of chiral symmetry due to the extremely high density of the nucleus. The findings provide evidence for the restoration of chiral symmetry at high matter density.
