***Key findings:*** Massless entanglement islands are recovered in [wedge holography](#key-definitions) with suitable DGP gravity or higher derivative gravity on the branes. The study considers different scenarios, including a black hole on the strong-gravity brane and a bath on the weak-gravity brane, as well as two black holes on the two branes with the same gravitational strength. 

***Application areas:*** The findings provide insights into the emergence of entanglement islands in holography and their relation to the gravitational strength on different branes. 

***Research implications:*** The existence of massless entanglement islands in [wedge holography](#key-definitions) suggests a deeper connection between entanglement and gravity in certain scenarios.

The study investigates the [swampland distance conjecture](#key-definitions) in higher-spin gravity. Multicritical generalizations of large-N vector models are studied, and the [quantum information distance](#key-definitions) along renormalization-group trajectories toward the higher-spin limit is computed. The study finds that infinite-distance limits in these models lead to a power-like decay, suggesting that exponential decays are characteristic of matrix-like gauge theories rather than vector models.

The study models the absorption of gravitational-wave energy by black holes in binary systems using an [effective worldline theory](#key-definitions). The horizon absorption is treated as tidal heating in the [effective worldline theory](#key-definitions), which includes tidally-induced quadrupole and octupole moments. The study calculates the contributions of horizon fluxes to the gravitational wave phasing through 4PN order and finds that they are significantly smaller than other contributions at the same PN order.

The study applies the conformal dispersion relation to compute the two-point function of local operators in the [critical O(N) model](#key-definitions) in the presence of a localized magnetic field. The study obtains the defect and bulk CFT data using the Lorentzian inversion formulae and discusses the implications of the results for the [critical O(N) model](#key-definitions).
