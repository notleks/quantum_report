This report summarises the latest key developments in the field of quantum research. 

Advanced ML topic modelling techniques where used to identify clusters of research papers based on the similarity of the language used in their abstracts. An importance scoring algorithm was then used to select a set of the key papers within each identified topic. The abstracts of these key papers were then passed to an LLM to provide a structured summary of each abstract and an overall summary of the whole set. 

The following topics were identified and summarised: 

[Advances in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)](quantum2_0.md)

[Advances in Quantum Gravity and Theoretical Physics](quantum2_1.md)

[Advances in Quantum Chemistry and Molecular Modeling](quantum2_2.md)

[Advances in Quantum Dot Research](quantum2_3.md)
